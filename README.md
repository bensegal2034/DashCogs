# DashCogs

Things I've made for Red. https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot

# Installation

Add this repo using

`[p]repo add DashCogs https://github.com/DashGit/DashCogs`

`[p]cog install DashCogs <cog name>`

And load each cog with

`[p]load <cog name>`

## gimage

Search for either one or multiple images on [Google Images](https://images.google.com). **This cog requires setup before use. Read below.**

To be able to use this cog, you need to enable Google Custom Search API, generate API key credentials and set a project. Simple steps on how to do this are provided below.

1) Visit https://console.developers.google.com and create a project.

2) Visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/customsearch.googleapis.com and enable "Custom Search API" for your project.

3) Visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and generate API key credentials for your project. This API key is necessary for later, so save it.

4) Visit https://cse.google.com/cse/all. Create a new custom search engine, with the search engine website being simply `google.com`. Go to edit the new search engine, and enable the 'image search' option. Also enable 'search the entire web'. Remove `google.com` under 'sites to search'. Note the text under 'search engine ID' is your Project CX. You will also need this later, so save it alongside the API key.

5) Give the bot the two pieces of data you should now have on hand, your API key and Project CX. Use `[p]gimageset apikey <key>` and `[p]gimageset projectCX <id>` to do this.

6) That's it! You are now ready to use gimage. 

**Commands**
* `[p]img <keyword> <amount>`: Display images in chat. Keyword is the search term, amount is the number of images you want to be displayed. 
* `[p]gimageset <setting>`: Manipulate various settings described below.
  * `[p]gimageset block <user> <list>`: Block or unblock a person from using GImage. If "list" is added after this command, it will print a list of all people currently blocked from using GImage.
  * `[p]gimageset apikey <key>`: Input your API key. See above for details.
  * `[p]gimageset projectCX <id>`: Input your Project CX. See above for details.

## selfmessage

Type messages using your bot's account. In order to send a message, PM the bot with what you would like to say. Make sure you've set the server and channel the bot should say the messages in first (using the commands listed below)!
**Note: Only the owner of the bot is allowed to do this. If you would like to allow someone else to access SelfMessage, add them with [p] toggleuser.**

**Commands**
* `[p]selfmessageset <setting>`: Manipulate various settings described below.
  * `[p]selfmessageset server <server>`: Sets the server the bot should look for channels in. The bot must be in the server specified.
  * `[p]selfmessageset channel <channel>`: Sets the channel the bot should send messages in. The channel must be one the bot can see.
  * `[p]selfmessageset enabled`: Toggles on and off whether the bot owner sending a PM to their bot will send a message.
  * `[p]selfmessageset user <user> <list>`: Toggles on and off whether someone can use the cog besides the bot owner. Add "list" to the end of this command to view all users allowed to use SelfMessage.

## pokemon
  
Play a text-based game based around the Pokemon series. Set up a whitelisted channel or two for the bot to post pokemon in, and guess their names! This cog was inspired by Pokecord, the popular Discord bot. As such, the cog offers the ability to import all owned pokemon from Pokecord. The aim is to provide a more customizable experience than Pokecord on a per-server basis.

**Commands**
* `[p]pokemonimport`: Import all your pokemon from Pokecord. The command will walk you through the steps to do so. Please note that this can only be done once per person.
* `[p]pokemoninfo <id>`: Display all your pokemon that you have caught. It is also possible to view a detailed readout of each caught pokemon's statistics by adding their ID after this command.
* `[p]pokemonselect <id>`: Select a pokemon to recieve EXP. If no pokemon is selected, this defaults to the first pokemon caught.
* `[p]pokemonlookup <search>`: Display a pokemon's base statistics. Can search by either name or ID.
* `[p]pokemonset <setting>`: Manipulate various settings described below.
  * `[p]pokmemonset debug`: Display values relevant for debugging.
  * `[p]pokmemonset listamt <amt>`: Change the amount of pokemon that will be displayed per page on `[p]pokemonlist`. Cannot be higher than 50.
  * `[p]pokmemonset randomlevels`: Toggle whether pokemon should spawn with a random level when caught. If off, all pokemon will be caught at level 1.
  * `[p]pokmemonset resetdata <type>`: Reset all data for either all guilds or all members in the server that the command is executed inside of. Only the bot owner can use this command.
  * `[p]pokmemonset spawntime`: Set the amount of time that it should take for a pokemon to spawn, in seconds. Cannot be less than or equal to 0. Can either be one value or two, if the bot should pick a random time between these two values for every pokemon spawned.
  * `[p]pokmemonset whitelist <list>`: Add the current channel to the whitelist, or list all currently whitelisted channels by adding "list" after this command.

## coinflip

Flip coins with a fancy animation. Can either be one coin or multiple coins.

**Commands**
* `[p]coinflip <type>`: Flip either one coin or multiple coins at once.
